It turned out to be a good choice to set all 0, to the standard deviation of the unconditioned maximum likelihood probabilities of the tags in the training corpus, i.e., we set for all i = 0 ... m — 1, using a tagset of s tags and the average (11) This usually yields values in the range 0,03 ... 0.10.
