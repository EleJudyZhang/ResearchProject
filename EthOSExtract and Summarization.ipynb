       "' \\nThe study discovered that interaction was a significant source of students’ success in \\nboth rural and urban areas. It was revealed that students appreciated the personal \\nsupport  offered  by  tutors  by  telephone,  and  were  also  impressed  by  the  audio \\ncassettes and video tapes that supplemented their study materials. However, it was \\nnoted that rural students felt disadvantaged in comparison to urban students; for \\nexample,  they  complained  about  insufficient  access  to  learning  resources  which \\naffected their studies and their ability to obtain high grades.  \\nThe issue of failure to access adequate resources among rural students was also an \\nissue  in  South  Africa  where  students  felt  overlooked,  marginalised  and  socially \\ndeprived by their institutions (Lephalala and Makoe, 2012). However, the study by \\nPurnell et al (1996) in Queensland, above, suggested the following ideas: widening \\naccess  to  tutors  with  distance  education  skills;  applying  technology  to  facilitate \\nstudents’  learning;  and  considering  the  needs  of  those  students  who  are \\ngeographically  isolated.  These  proposed  measures  would  enhance  effective \\ninteraction with students, motivate students to learn and provide access to academic \\nguidance and feedback, all of which are crucial in sustaining students’ academic \\nprogress.   \\nAnother study that examined students’ experiences in rural and urban areas was \\nconducted at the University of South Pacific by Landbeck and Mugler (2000). This \\nstudy  was  done  with  78  extension  students  and  used  interviews  to  generate \\ninformation.

The \\nstudy by Purnell et al (1996) above indicate that students were provided with course \\nmaterials  that  were  supplemented  by  recorded  learning  materials  such  as  audio \\ncassettes and video tapes.  This suggests that the provision of course materials alone \\n \\n  83  \\nwas inadequate to facilitate students’ learning and the development of their skills, \\ncompetencies and knowledge.

       "' the study discovered that interaction was a significant source of students’ success in both rural and urban areas. it was revealed that students appreciated the personal support offered by tutors by telephone and were also impressed by the audio cassettes and video tapes that supplemented their study materials. however it was noted that rural students felt disadvantaged in comparison to urban students for example they complained about insufficient access to learning resources which affected their studies and their ability to obtain high grades. the issue of failure to access adequate resources among rural students was also an issue in south africa where students felt overlooked marginalised and socially deprived by their institutions . however the study by purnell et al in queensland above suggested the following ideas: widening access to tutors with distance education skills applying technology to facilitate students’ learning and considering the needs of those students who are geographically isolated. these proposed measures would enhance effective interaction with students motivate students to learn and provide access to academic guidance and feedback all of which are crucial in sustaining students’ academic progress. another study that examined students’ experiences in rural and urban areas was conducted at the university of south pacific by landbeck and mugler . this study was done with extension students and used interviews to generate information. the study found that students adopted only a surface approach to learning influenced largely by their overdependence on the course study materials provided by the university. in addition the students observed experienced inadequate basic resources such as books and tutor support in guidance correction and answering questions. the experience of students at the university of south pacific differs from that of the students at queensland australia as presented by purnell et al above. the study by purnell et al above indicate that students were provided with course materials that were supplemented by recorded learning materials such as audio cassettes and video tapes. this suggests that the provision of course materials alone was inadequate to facilitate students’ learning and the development of their skills competencies and knowledge. instead supplementing the course materials with other forms of academic support such as access to tutors learning materials and library resources would help students to fully realise their academic potential. the study conducted by landbeck and mugler above also indicates the disparity between rural and urban students. the study noted that students in urban areas were comfortable in using audio-or video tapes although this was not the case among students in rural areas who had limited access to electricity. the absence of electricity forced rural students to continue to rely upon the course materials provided by their institution. in attempting to rectify the situation the study recommended the strengthening of face-to-face interaction among students and tutors. the experience derived from the study conducted at the university of south pacific is significant as it captured the wider context of rural and urban areas. however it is challenged by the fact that it had only one source of data and one method which limited the opportunity to discover rich and more descriptive data. for validity purposes this study could have engaged in other research methods such as observation and documentation and also widened its sampling scope for data triangulation purposes. another interesting study on students’ experiences was conducted by srivastava and reddy . this study examined the experiences of graduate students at the indira gandhi national open university . the purpose was to discover factors that contributed to the successful completion of students’ studies. the study looked at instructional methods support services and study habits. questionnaires and interviews were used as data collection methods. the study revealed that the successful completion of studies by students depended upon a combination of factors which included: learning materials assignments face-to-face support regional centres peer groups guidance from counsellors and access to library services. the study noted that students were not really interested in using e-mail teleconferencing or radio counselling. however their inflexibility caused them to depend on printed self-learning materials and non-technological support. perhaps this was influenced by the low access they had to technology and by their own educational backgrounds. despite students’ use of non-technological support systems at ignou the study noted that very few students completed their studies on time. the study conducted at ignou recommended the following actions to be taken in order to improve the students’ situations: empower students to develop knowledge the use of media to facilitate students’ learning an emphasis on induction and a focus on continuous evaluation. while these suggestions are significant in perhaps enhancing the academic prospects of students they are also inadequate as they only focus on the institutional context forgetting that students occupy multiple spaces at the same time. indeed other places such as the home and the work place for example can also negatively affect students’ learning outcomes. therefore consideration of factors such as students’ educational backgrounds their personal living contexts their social and economic activities and the extent to which they are engaged in learning within their own locations could provide a more comprehensive picture of the reasons for low graduate rates at ignou. an examination of each or all of these aspects would have helped academics to understand why these students failed to finish their course on time. a study with a rural orientation was conducted with undergraduate and postgraduate students at an australian university . it explored the experience of remote students in the period -. the study solicited information from student participants through the use of -minute semi-structured telephone interviews. the study noted that all of the students who participated in the study used computers that were accessible within the university and at their homes. despite the access to media and technology within students’ locations the findings indicated that students experienced a number of difficulties in relation to internet services satellite connections and costs. they also occasionally received emails or had online discussions and telephone calls. these technological difficulties show that the use of technology in teaching and learning is not free of challenges. the findings also indicated that the high postage costs affected the sending and subsequent delivery of study materials. students also felt isolated and lacked orientation compared to on-campus students. regardless of the challenges owens et al did report that most distance students received adequate library support and appreciated the role of mentors in reducing their feelings of isolation. moreover the university provided elive sessions and conducted course review sessions that attempted to meet the students’ needs. the study conducted by owens et al at the australian university lacked the visual cues suitable for further probing in qualitative research . collecting data through face-to-face interviews enables researchers to establish a closer relationship with students and to understand visual cues that might provide further useful information. moreover the use of multiple sources of methods such as documents and observation would have been useful in supplementing the information that was missed in the interviews. mbukusa conducted a study in namibia which explored barriers facing remote students at the centre for external studies at the university of namibia. this qualitative study focused on six students who had dropped out from their bachelor of education and basic education teachers’ diploma courses. the study adopted a case study approach and used research diaries documents and interviews for data collection purposes. the study discovered that students experienced inadequate access to academic support which meant that their academic needs were unmet. they were also faced with poor infrastructure issues and other administrative problems. the study by mbukusa above made the following proposals: the enhancement of effective interaction decentralising support to the regional centres and the provision of social support in order to facilitate the education of students. a number of other recommendations were also made: an improvement in media facilities the provision of policy issues relating to ict the creation of rural infrastructure and the effective use of resources for the benefit of rural students. the research design and methods adopted for data collection were compatible with the needs of the study. however a comparative approach between continuing students and student dropouts might have provided more revealing results which in turn might have helped to improve support practices within the university. another study on rural areas was conducted with students of the open university in the uk who lived in scotland . it focused on students’ perceptions and their feelings of remoteness and identity. the study adopted a qualitative research approach and utilized semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions as data collection methods. twenty students were sampled and interviewed in telephone interviews that lasted for - minutes. interviewees were then invited to group discussions that took place in nearby centres. macintyre and macdonald discovered that each student had access at home to learning facilities such as internet services and laptops. their learning was facilitated by online meetings emails telephone services and face-to-face discussions. therefore students had strong interaction with their course tutors and colleagues although their feelings of remoteness were aggravated by other factors such as poor roads and uncertain transport services. such experiences can be compared to the study conducted in the usa where university students opted for distance education courses because of the problems of transport and inflexible course schedules in other systems of education . students decided to study programmes that were offered through teleconferencing . however the study reveals that students experienced emotional disconnectedness as they would have preferred to bond with their peers through face-to-face interaction. this could be considered as a barrier to the effective use of technology as individuals’ particular needs might not be met by the particular solutions that technology offers. macintyre and macdonald above proposed to continue peer interaction and recommended the establishment of social groups and local examination centres near students’ locations so as to reduce the problem of transport. these recommendations are relevant ones as they help to develop a sense of belonging among students and might enable students to share their learning and social experiences with each other. the suggested strategies could also be useful in rural developing countries where students experience high levels of isolation due to their infrequent interaction with peers and tutors . the findings from the study conducted in the developed world by owens et al and macintyre and macdonald differ significantly from studies on students’ experiences in developing countries. the main differences are related to modern technology and how students in rural areas can gain relevant access to it. for example studies conducted in indonesia south africa and tanzania show that students lacked the skills to use ict properly while their access to the internet was limited and suffered from poor transmission quality. moreover rye and zubaidah went further by explaining that the available internet services in indonesia were limited to commercial centres and students’ offices unlike the studies conducted in australia and scotland where students had access to internet services in various locations including at home and in the established study centres . such differences demonstrate the existing technological gap between the developing and developed worlds. despite the technological challenges that the developing countries face universities such as mozambique and cape verde are now using online learning to teach their students . however the infrastructural limitations mean that they also use traditional methods such as radio broadcasting face-to-face tutor support and printed learning materials alongside their online learning provision. that is to say that these universities have adopted a system of blended learning to enhance the effective provision of education to their students. the use of blended learning by the universities of cape verde and mozambique demonstrated above has the potential to enable students and tutors to interact through more than one medium of communication: for example it is flexible as it allows students to study at their own selected time it provides consistency in accessing '"
